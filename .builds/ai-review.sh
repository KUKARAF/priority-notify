# Runs on every push (via .build.yml). Reviews the diff since the last
# reviewed commit with `hermes` running the code-review skill. hermes writes
# its findings to good.md/ticket.md (plain file writes — this is the only
# thing it does that has any effect outside its own working directory) and
# this wrapper script, never hermes itself, is the only thing that touches
# `hut`/todo.sr.ht credentials: it reads ticket.md and files a ticket only if
# non-empty. State (the last reviewed SHA) lives as a comment thread on a
# pinned ticket in the same tracker — see #STATE_TICKET.
